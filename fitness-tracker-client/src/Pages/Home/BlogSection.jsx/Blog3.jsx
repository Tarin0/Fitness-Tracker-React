                        <span className="text-xl font-semibold">Immersive Fitness</span> <br/>
                        Immersive fitness takes your workout to the next level by using virtual reality technology to transport you to a different world. With this trend, you can be running on a treadmill while feeling like you’re exploring the Amazon rainforest or skiing down a mountain. The technology syncs up with your movements, making it an interactive experience that can increase your motivation to work out. This trend has been gaining popularity, especially during the pandemic, as it provides an escape from reality and allows people to exercise in a fun and engaging way.
                        <br/><span className="text-xl font-semibold">Micro Workouts</span> <br/>
                        Micro workouts are quick and efficient workouts that can be done anywhere, anytime, and with minimal equipment. They typically last anywhere from five to fifteen minutes and focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or bodyweight exercises. These workouts are perfect for busy individuals who have a hard time finding the time to exercise. Micro workouts can also be used to supplement longer workouts or as a way to break up a sedentary workday.

                        <br/><span className="text-xl font-semibold">Mental Health Workouts</span> <br/>
                        Mental health workouts are exercise programs that focus on improving mental health as much as physical health. These workouts use mindfulness, meditation, and breathing techniques to help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Mental health workouts are becoming more popular as people are beginning to understand the connection between physical health and mental well-being. They provide a holistic approach to fitness that can benefit both the mind and body.
                        <br/><span className="text-xl font-semibold">Outdoor Workouts</span> <br/>
                        Outdoor workouts have become increasingly popular during the pandemic as people look for ways to exercise safely. Outdoor workouts can include activities like hiking, biking, or kayaking, or simply doing a bodyweight workout in a local park. Exercising outdoors provides many benefits, including fresh air, sunshine, and a change of scenery. It can also be a great way to connect with nature and relieve stress.
